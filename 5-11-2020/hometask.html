    What are the treatments for ADHD?
  </li>
  <li class="a">The best treatment for ADHD is thought to be a combination of medication and psychological and behavioral therapies. Therapists, doctors, teachers, and parents should work closely together -- team meetings can help.</li>
  <li class="q">
    What is the test for ADHD?
  </li>
  <li class="a">There is no single test for ADHD. Doctors diagnose ADHD in children and teens after discussing symptoms at length with the child, parents, and teachers and observing the child's behaviors. The doctor will also gather information about any similar problems that run in the family and consider all possible causes.

    To confirm a diagnosis of ADHD or learning differences, a battery of tests may be given to assess a child's neurological and psychological status. The tests should be given by a pediatrician or mental health provider with experience in diagnosing and treating ADHD .</li>
  <li class="q">
    Which stimulants are used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children?

  </li>
  <li class="a">The first drugs doctors commonly used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are stimulant medicines such as:

    Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin)
    Dextroamphetamine (Adderall)
    Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)
    Methylphenidate (Concerta, Quillivant, Ritalin)
    It is thought that these medicines improve ADHD symptoms by making more of the chemical dopamine available to the brain. Dopamine is found in areas of the brain that control mood and attention.</li>
